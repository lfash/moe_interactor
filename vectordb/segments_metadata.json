We, where I live, I think in a lot of places, we just had a cold front, and so there was a lot of snow that fell on the ground. And so then it goes through this natural process of the snow starts melting, and then it packs, and then it makes the ground muddy, and then the mud is kind of sinking, and then it forms a layer over, like the grass or whatever other texture. And then over time, it'll dry up, or it'll sink deeper into the ground or whatever it does, and that could happen again. Or as you go into spring, there's a different movement. And so Speaker 1 16:10 ordinarily that's that's all fine. And I think maybe sometimes we'll over identify with, okay, I can touch the grass again as the vitality, but actually the whole process is the natural movement, yes, but the mud gets stuck, and so it stays slimy. And then there's all these problems with identification, of like, I'm the person who's like, trying to dig through the mud, and I'm so tired, and, um, I want to touch the grass, which is fine to have as a desire, but why does it always feel like this is the issue where the snow is melted but the mud is still there, And like we're trying to dig too hard, because that's not the way to work it.

This, this is a great question, and I think I would say is if you are operating most of the time in a normal state of consciousness, then the rules in that place is to really Look for the aliveness and begin to recognize its presence, as well as also how and where it get how it gets hidden. So you can sometimes, most optimally do this in other people before yourself. It's a fun way to learn it in yourself is to begin to like, scan the world around you as you're moving through life, for those touch points that are there.

So in general, a victim mentality will come from the experience of long term, repeated non existence, and it will particularly come from the flavor of exploitation. Non existence can happen for us out of neglect, but it can also happen out of exploitation. We can feel victimized by neglect, but we really feel victimized when we have been exploited or manipulated. The that mentality is a kind of identity formation early on within us, that identity formation becomes an archetype within us, that existence attaches to as a way to feed on itself to gain more existence. And if you know that experience, it's very cyclical, right? It keeps trying to express through the victim mentality as a way to finally be seen, finally be remediated, finally be qualified. But it never can receive that qualification, because the way it is being fed is in the powerless dance. If it were to move into the stance of being in power, in right relationship with power, it would lose and have to die to the victim mentality.

Because, you know, they their aunt, their ancestors and their families had been totally obliterated, and so many Somalian men got sent to Vermont, and when I worked with some of them, the frequency of the trauma and the frequency of the belief system around safety was incredibly different than African American men that I've worked with, and believe it or Not, their sense of safety was much stronger than African American men, even they through repeated war time, but their lineage was intact. So because their lineage was intact, there was a sense of communal and tribal belonging that was absent and had been colonized out in an African American system. I remember maybe about six months ago, I was somewhere, and I was waiting in line at like a judiciary office or something. So it was a long line, and there were people in front of me, and there were these, this group of African American folks, maybe like two or three people in front of me. It wa",

But what is really true that I have discovered is that there's a way where this whole game becomes organized differently, and that is the thing that I think we don't speak about enough, is that when you get to that place where it is organized differently, it's because your frame has changed, and your frame only changes because you move from functioning from the trauma body to functioning from what I call the art body, is the creative body. And this is not the place of like you're in the trauma body, but you're making art. I mean, that can be some of it, but this is the place where every engagement is is an awareness that you are art making in the same way that there gets to places in your practice or your life, where you recognize that everything you're doing is prayer. And to me, prayer is the same as art making. It's just engagement with the world in a way that is generative and creative with with less disruption. And so being self sourced is part of that same package that's like the cluster of what kind of begins to happen. You can't be art making if you're not self sourced.

Bree 6:09 So in the adaptive body, there is a consciousness believes that power comes from a kind of agency born from and within control. Very much believes in selfhood as the agent that's very different from the fields of existence or the emergent body. That body understands that power is actually not individual, but as part of a unified field of consciousness, and that is ecosystemic in nature. Attribute of that field understands that if I help you to be in power, I will also be in more power, not as a source of generosity or kindness, but as an understanding about the intricate interconnectedness that we all share, that if any one piece of that interconnectedness is off, even by a degree, everything will be in a kind of distortion. This is true at a micro sense in you, a wholeness perspective. And it is also true in a meta sense, everybody you come into contact with and who contacts you, existence fields, intelligence just knows this. Okay, other differences the adaptive body.

It's a different layer. And so we were discussing the ways in which, like so many of these models, can bring you to those places, and you can have pretty powerful experiences when you come back into life. Those experiences either aren't translating or they seem to be at odds with where you are in your regular daily life. And you hear this a lot with, like meditation practices, with yoga practices, people have these experiences. They go back to their regular life, and they find that they have this like ability to kind of integrate these things, where it feels sustainable and where they're touching both places, essentially. So one of the things that I have thought about a lot in both the creation and the dissemination of this model is it is purposefully one that straddles realities.

When I start with people in additions, and when I teach it, and when I teach practitioners, I teach them the end first. So if there is an end, if there is a place, this is all going towards true integration with existence, which is innocence, I start with existence. The conventional system for addictions doesn't even understand existence. It isn't even an A what it understands is a break from symptoms, a kind of sobriety that has to do with behaviors. In my model, the behaviors break close to the last that doesn't mean that we don't often give up behaviors as part of the process and then get them back and give them up. But my version of breaking the addictive cycle has to do with the innervation of the emergent body of existence. It is, like I used to say it this way, that one day when I was really trying to break this cycle, not of addiction, but of the pattern itself and understanding got broken in others.

Anybody in here who has had experiences with trauma, which is all of us, know that the fracturing is a result of the imposition of not only the rupture of belonging, but the templating of compliance to a certain kind of belonging that may not be innate to you, that fracturing creates its own kind of chaos.

It's a kind of chaos that comes from a breaking apart purposefully, not from the intelligence coming from the singularity, to find itself again in a new form of physics and organization. So as a result of all of that, I started playing with practice a lot. And I started playing with open awareness, because I became open awareness, so it was the only place to play.

In addition, when you encounter mergence, you will encounter a field that is so much bigger and more powerful than you that if your commodification of love has not been sufficient before, then you will feel that absence 20 fold. We don't have societies or situations where that love is supporting as a bridge.

But you'll be standing there oscillating between many different variables until enough of that critical mass is dancing together, and you finally there will be a moment where it will go. So none of this is wrong. This is part of sometimes how developmental leaps happen, right?

Then, in some ways, it still isn't collapsing the the architecture. Do you know what I mean?

Okay, let me see if there's anything else about that. And if you're a practitioner, which is everybody, pretty much, and you're struggling still with your own experiences of power, you're going to struggle with the counter transference around power with your clients. And look, your clients are going to be experts at getting you there. They're going to find every hole that's there in your power and they're going to test you at all of those holes. Because what they want, they want you to be unflinching in the face of their rage, their trauma, their power games, all of it, because on some level, it's all a power game in neutrality, that's what I mean, not a purposeful power game.

So if existence, the undistorted distilled movement coming directly from your diversified self within the larger ecosystem of the erotic itself. It comes through with your tone, your taste, your esthetic, if existence is truth, then any adaptation to existence will feel to existence like a lie. It will be bringing away or mitigating or watering down that truth and to existence, it will feel like a lie. Now, if an entire framework is built from the adaptive body, then what happens is existence goes into a secondary or what I call a default position instead of a primary or exalted position. You guys have not heard me use those words yet, but this is another terminology that I use to designate the energetics of the reversal. When that happens, we adapt to the adaptive body being primary, both in our minds and in our schemas, in our rationalizations, in our psyches, but we never adapt to that being primary in our bodies, which is part of why you have huge disease states that come up from this, many of them chronic and seemingly unhealable. So there's another piece I want you guys with these mechanics, is that, in addition, there is an automatic withholding happening here. This is not a purposeful withholding. This is a shift of celestial bodies withholding. That withholding means that there is an entire from small to large body of your existence, field your existence expression that is in withholding.

These are the implicit beliefs that we have about what it is that we cannot change deepest places that we or don't move from. Don't forget that moving and not moving is a move. So loyalty is most easily viewed in it is most easily viewed in the places where you are familiar with abusive or addictive family systems. Let me explain, in addictive family systems, there is a forced kind of loyalty, right? This is the double bind. You must comply, and you must comply with that framework that way. And if you don't, it feels like you will be disowned, die, etc. You guys know all of this after a good amount of time of being forced into loyalty, now you no longer need to be forced. Instead, you are willingly compliant with that even once it's gone. This is the reason that people stay in a place which they are wanting to leave, that family system may actually physically leave, but the loyalty to its energy, its way, is still so deeply inside of them. Why is this? It's because loyalty has become part of existence, and existence is now tied to that way.

This is a process of moving from chaos, not the good chaos, but noise. Chaos demand chaos to simplicity and emptiness. And this is emptiness as a base way, not emptiness as a permanent state. So one of the requirements in this is that you move, continually through this. of release. This is not one release. It is 1000s upon 1000s of releases. And it is not a release that you are demanding of yourself. It is a release that begins as a practice and results in an entrainment, a reclamation around release. as the kind of state of movement. And what I mean by that is that release as a state of movement a consistent form, the evolution. It does not hold or attach to anything as being solid, other than the state of movement itself. So again, we start as a practice with this. Because even though this is natural to us, what has been built for a very long time in an unnatural way, is state of permanence or control, where the illusion that we can hold on to anything, anyone or any place beyond the actual movement of us within it and it within us is wrong. It's completely a lie. So one of the things that systemic oppression does so solidly is it traps you in a space in which you cannot release. This is because, as you know, with the double bind, both sides, or all sides, seem to contain something that is necessary. At least, this is the case with the most fundamen",

And so in that moment, I had to decide what was I going to do with that. And if I had been really, really in the control mode, I would have maybe sat down to explain all of that to him in a way that could make him feel understanding, and we could still repair the relationship.

So there won't be this identity of compassion or kindness. So what do we want to say about that that intimacy is the hardest in general, with things that are and people that are human. So it's much easier to have the intimacy with the trees and the ocean and the sound and the wind than it is with like your boyfriend you know, or like your mother, and that is because, obviously, in these relational templating that we all have, we've been harmed. Love has been used to harm us, and we have used love against others. Yes, we can't get rejected. There's no leveraging of belonging in those spaces. So the stakes are very, very different. So the place where you're usually working, the things I'm talking about in the addictive cycles, is going to be within yourself and in interpersonal relationship, intimacy that is really clear does not come through in the presence of control.

So when I was in the early years of like having this experience in myself, which was informing me to figure out that then I was going to teach this.

I don't know when he did that, but Gregory Bateson talked about schizophrenic mothers and the ways in which they created double binds for their children who went on to have schizophrenia. And what he was basically saying was that schizophrenia may not be what we think it is, that it is probably. Actually, or possibly, from this root of mothers presenting this no win situation to their children, and that in this no win situation, there's kind of this crazy making that happens in a child where their coherence of selfhood gets fragmented and very chaotic, because they never know What is the right thing to do, and so for um, for me, the double bind is about that chaos creation, bu",

I've tried to do that 1000 times, right, which is basically with one of the double binds, okay? Right? It's like, oh, that's the problem, right? Like, my job is the problem, or my relationship is the problem, whatever it is, right? And so I was trying to, like, heal. And of course, because now we see the result of where this was taking me, because it was the intelligence was aimed towards this, literally, $15,000 later, nothing had changed. That was because that wasn't the right action. And what I kept seeing was that, in fact, there was this ever changing landscape of double binds that would keep producing themselves. And I would say that this is the most beautiful illustration of an eating disorder, which is that an eating disorder is the most resilient and resistant to treatment in all the mental health disorders that I know, you can knock the thing out in 15 different places, and it is growing a new arm that looks different, but is the exact same aperture.

This is because, as you know, with the double bind, both sides, or all sides, seem to contain something that is necessary. At least, this is the case with the most fundamental double binds. As you go outside of that, it feels like everything is necessary. But it is actually not true. This is just the replication of the pattern further out from the center, but at that center, which is formative and attacks the primal, formative body, it will feel like you must hold on for dear life. And this inability to release is actually where control structures of psychology and somatics are built from and upon. So we do this practice to release over and over again to give permission to breathe life back into the movement itself. When you cannot release, it is breath, it is Prana. It is Chi that is being restricted from its own natural movement. And of course, as you begin to open the space after being closed and in solidification for a long time, you will notice points of chaos.

So I'm saying all of this to you today. Just remind you to keep your eye gently on where this is going and how it goes. And I hope, as you listen, you feel how damn attainable this is, because this is not about you against anything or you for something that everybody else is against. This is about you being for life itself, for the movement of love itself, for your own existence as it is that is the restoring of right order. And it is something that is accomplishable, not in one, but in all of us, and the more of us that get there as we get there together and make contact. For me, of that contact being bound, or that togetherness being glued by CO dependency, then what happens is we create massive movement, energetically and in the physics of the planet.

It does not need to fight to change any thing. And it also does not mean that it does not take a stand. The lack of defended fight is the stand that is possible to be taken we are weakening ourselves when we are trying to develop something that is natural. It has to collapse at some point into the natural form of movement. If you feel your own upright existence, fight or flight may happen, but it will not hijack your system. You won't react from it. It can be present, but you will be separate from it. This is why existence is so important, because the body can still go through the whole trauma response, but you will not be hijacked by the trauma response. You will only be hijacked when there is still the experience that is deep inside of you, of what it feels like to not exist enough and to try and claim or earn existence back.

They occlude the field with how much they matter. They seem like the only thing that's there. As things move, they don't take center stage anymore. Doesn't mean that they're not happening. Their power is not as strong, and part of that is you have learned to then incorporate, integrate and anchor power from a completely different field of existence. You're not relying on that for existence anymore, and you don't even believe it as existence anymore. And it takes practice. It also takes community like this, honestly, where there are places that you can practice it, where also you can feel the vibrancy of the field feeding you without having to work for anything. You don't have to earn it, where it just is implicit, and where you can touch it and have it touch you and feed you, and you can la",

So what happens when the inside stuff dies, which is like your relationship to all of the outside stuff, the way that you're oriented towards it.

You can't respond to it the same way, because the way they're working it is from a very different stance, from a very different vantage point, and the reasons for its presence are also very different, and may have some similarities.

Systemic oppression is like the other constellation that is more like the abuse that's where the double bind lives or originates, and so these two constellations or bodies like kind of dance with each other. Okay, so within both these spaces are quote, unquote, stories that perpetuate and lock in the iteration of this pattern itself, regardless of the outer components, the oppressive consciousness is comprised of threat, entrapment, dominance, rage, terror, and it is afraid of itself and it won't and doesn't want to let go. These are like key energetic attributes to that field that is spoon spurned from the oppressive system. This constellation, or fractal map, can shift based on situation and conditions. It is spurned by double binds, seemingly inescapable, no win choices that create the exiling of innocence in exchange for survival, that innocence may lie dormant for much of life, and then life is lived in response to its absence and the lack of power resultant from its absence.

And so this is part of why it's really tricky to navigate that. Yeah, I'll just say that like, I think for a while we use discernment to understand the difference between those two bodies and the presence of them, but when enough time has gone on and enough integration, it really is just the aliveness we're paying attention to. More than needing to discern between the flickering and what you begin to notice is that the aliveness, it wants to play with others.

One is that when the stakes feel high for exposure and meaning, when it doesn't feel safe or there's a risk of safety, the primal body will often go into freeze everywhere in the body. And the other thing that I want to say is that the voice itself is often buried long before this, as you said, and in almost everybody, particularly in female bodies, the throat is almost always out.

And that's the line that Unknown Speaker 35:49 you're really dancing with. There's no Bree 35:50 right or wrong way. It's just, again, you know, control will take any practice to try to attain a goal. And for those of us who have survived for a long time. We're very entrained around knowing how to be better at being a good person or getting what we need. And so there's this dance between again, like using. a strategy, but also just releasing. And I would say the best way to get comfortable with the releasing is really in a meditation practice where you witness phenomena, and as you witness it, you see phenomena until the phenomena no longer exists in the field. So you can entrain attention on phenomena, and you will literally see the phenomena arise a cold and then, if you watch long enough, it will go back to blank again, where it will shift to the next phenomena, whether that's a thought, a sensation, an an idea, whatever it is, and the practice of seeing that, in some ways, will allow you to orient towards that place of being able to hold attention and then release.

Like you need the pleasure to actually activate the movement in those spaces. So it's a mess with pleasure. It's a mess because we have conflated pleasure with love, transactional love. Not not power love, but transactional love, human relating, kind of love. And because we have been so sanitized from pleasure as a society, I would say that we're so starved for it that it has become both forbidden and hunted and also withheld. So I think about pleasure more in the way of sensuality like I like sensuality as a vehicle for pleasure. And I like to talk to people about sensuality first, as not being sexual, but being tangible or sensing.

So there's probably people who would speak about it better, but I would say that, in my experience, Bipolar is way over diagnosed, and of a lot of it has to do with the collapse and control continuum, where people are so controlled that then they're going into collapse, and then when they are trying to come out of collapse, they are basically like, like, racking their nervous system up by either starving themselves physically or staying up too much or binging on, like, porn.

As you progress from one to five, you are expanding the system energetically, and so that colonization is now being reordered, so that it is not as dominant.

These aspects of me develop in response to the absence of these aspects of me. And it's cool, if you're a lot around little kids, because you can see it happening. You can actually begin to see the frame of the family imprinting itself on the child, and the child both rebelling against and cooperating with that frame. And all children will do that because they for survival reasons. They have to cooperate with the frame. Here's another interesting thing, which is that you could have a parent who's very aware, who is trying to change the frame they came from, but if that frame has not been pulled out at the roots, even if they're doing something different than their parents did, the same imprint is present because they're reacting to the imprint by doing the different thing. So there's a stream in the midst of all of this that is not about collapse and it isn't about reaction. It is simply about sourcing your own movements that don't come from this place of being in a trauma response or being in a response to anything, quite frankly, except yourself.

Part of that has to do with my many years of training in the world of psychology. Part of that has to do with the currency and language that we are most familiar with in this culture, which is that even in the world of spirituality, in this culture, we tend to use a lot of language that translates through the body of the psychology. We think it's an asset, but in fact, it has become a terrible limitation, because we are deeply over focusing on that part of the being, and we're under focusing on many others. So you're going to hear me talk a little bit more about physics and structure, rather than just psychology. What I mean by that is that the physics is the energetic but it is also the kind of way that our psychology, our somatics, our culture, our ancestry and our current conditions combine to create kind of an energetic pattern and flow within us. It has a particular order to it, and that order almost always included or against in places the natural order. This is the heart of most of what I talk about in my work when we look at returning systems to states of generativity, states of vibrancy, direct connection with larger intelligence that is creative in nature, we can say erotic in nature, is also connected to the way that that energy wants to flow through you in particular, and each person will have a different way that it flows t",

Even if that container of belonging has to do with things like domestic abuse or domestic violence, doesn't matter. It's still the frame of safety for that family, and you can think of it as like a cell wall, or like a bubble, or like a net. So a great or easy example would be like a three or five year old, for example, who has that template inside of them, but at three or five years old in general, unless there has been extreme trauma after you have been born like a violent household, a loss of a parent, a loss of a sibling, something that would really disrupt generally, when you're that young, you still have a lot of your own erotic life force Running, because that's the thing that has not yet matured into the personality characteristics, right?

Right? That's what the teenage years are about. Is individuation. Every point of individuation connects to points of power. And so when that started to happen for her, ironically, she was home with me because we had pulled her out to homeschool her. It's the most difficult time to have a kid with you. 24/7, and she was with me. I couldn't even pee. The kid was with me, and I was in the middle of a massive spiritual awakening.

So they're predocations for different styles of responses. We don't need to go off on a tangent to evaluate our attachment styles.

What is answering the starvation as your ability to hold the tension, your ability to hold the tension grows a capacity and a fluidity within you that becomes part of that spine, And it's it's not even that cognitive, it's just energetic.

And if somebody doesn't tell you what flickering is, it will be likely that you will think you are losing your mind, because your perception will be so altered and ungrounded by its transformative state between those two bodies. The way I usually think about flickering is when you are going back and forth between not just emotional states, but states of consciousness. And it could be true that that's some of what's happening for you, too, is that it's not just the emotional state, but it is actually a different consciousness that's present. It can also happen with time, depending on whether time is a factor of awakening. For us, for some people, it is more dominant than others. I mean, for about eight years, I experienced myself as completely being what I would say, out of time, and I'm still not in time, but it's very different now than it was then. And so there's a kind of like the flickering between states usually is experienced as, like your view changes, like your state of being changes, and the whole thing you're looking through a completely different field in in the beginning of emergence, this really happens because there's a different consciousness that now is pollinating your body and your being, and so flickering might be very, very fast and very, very disruptive.

It's not any worse or better, it's just a different primal body experience because the primal body has either had some developmental milestones or not, and that is key.

When I talk about the architecture of going from CO dependency to exit sourcing the existence field, it's going to come up again when I talk about techniques for falling between them. I think that that to develop taste right like you, you renounce because you know that your hunger is ultimately leading you to a kind of fullness that won't be satisfied any other way. And there's a better location towards that, I think in some of us, that's relentless as hell, but I think that that taste can also be pollinated. Think that there's a way that when you carry that and you're around other people, they remember that in themselves, even if they have forgotten. And I think with with those",

So I want to talk a little bit about narcissistic extortion and the adaptive body and the presencing of the field of existence. So you already know at this point that the field of existence is often running through the filter or the architecture of the adaptive body. What this means is that when you go to collapse the adaptive body, meaning some of the belief systems, some of the mores, some of what I call the untouchables, you will also reveal that there are seeds or aspects within there that are absolutely true. They are core truths that are not just inherited ideologies or identities, but they are things that are true to your being. When you find those, those are often the things that narcissistic systems go after and exploit in order to keep you hooked on the system of the adaptive body. Now remember that the adaptive body cannot stay alive without the presencing of love and the erotic. So it feeds on that. It needs that now that can be synergistic as well. When the two bodies are in coherence, that means that they are reciprocal with each other, but that the existence field itself is the primary mover, informer and the primary order, not the adaptive body. When the adaptive body is primary in somebody, they need the food and fuel of the existence field. Or you can think about it as the erotic and the love in all of its primal iterations in or",

Now, because we're relational by nature, we don't love being in a vacuum, and so we want that experience of dancing with another, whether that be a tree, a witness ocean, an ancestor, whatever it is. We want that experience because we're built for that relationality. It's important to not put your aim there only because that breeds and rebirths a deeply co dependent frame. And this is the problem that we're up against, which is that we are all living in the physics and the environment of a deeply dependency oriented frame while attempting to transition out of it into a frame that is rooted elsewhere. When that frame is rooted elsewhere, the physics are markedly different, and how those physics want to move, can move and desire movement does not fit with the frame of CO dependency or dependency.

What you guys are learning in foundations is mostly the intellectual part of the work. It's the mechanics of it. It's the blueprints of how two completely different forms of reality dance with one another, and what happens when one of those versions of reality is the favored or dominant one, and what happens to the actual possibilities of expansion individuation, maturation and expression, when the colonization or the dominance of one framework for reality has been The only truth in bodies for hundreds of years. What happens in that case is that we create multiple strands of compensatory expression and tributaries in order to cope with that primary restriction. And if you think about it as being many generations old, then what you understand is that the belief systems and the walls or limits of that particular body become the accepted norm. Right? You can't challenge those things. They're so deeply intrinsic and implicit.

Don't like to talk about healing that. I don't think healing is the right word that goes with that.

No, the world is still fucking, extorting and raping, but enough of us are doing this, it creates a kind of nodal point, and this is why I am so am on fire to get it out there, because the truth is, everybody needs this, and the more of us there are in right relationship, not right concept, but right relationship.

Again, homeostasis is found through actually action, not contemplation of action. Contemplation of action is constipating. Got to take the shit, not just hold the shit in. If you can't take action, then you have to find a proxy space to take action in. But it is important that the action gets to do three things, say what it needs to say as close to the bone in the truth as possible. Say it as loud and as strongly or as soft and as kindly as it needs. Then it gets to do it until it is truly done. I when that happens, you have moved the power again. Stay really hung in the hangman's place in this because the people who are exploiting us don't want to come to the table to receive that. It's like, No thank you. I just exploited you so I could feel I had your power, not so I can come find resolution. And so in general, this is why we need proxy spaces. Let me tell you, in my experience, lighting a candle and saying a prayer does not do it. It's not to say that ritual isn't important. You'll never hear me say that, but that that is often a workaround or an adaptive strategy, because we're afraid of the power and the anger that's there.

This was the Holocaust right in Germany. They made like the Jews, the gypsies, whatever, didn't matter. The Category those people had to be in default so certain other people could stay with power. Trump is doing it in this country. We're gonna deport all the brown, Mexican, whatever, the fuck people so that. But basically, it doesn't matter who it is. It's the idea that somebody or something will be triangulated into the position of disempowerment. When they get triangulated into the position of disempowerment, it takes these other people into power, but it is a false structure of power. Those are not true structures of power. So as a result, they can only last by being fed by more and more of this. This is why they are inherently not sustainable. Don't belong. They have to find their belonging through extraction or dominance or disempowerment. And look, when that's the game, that's the only game on offer, and you're a kid, you learn how to play that game.

I always refer to this stuff as like seasons. I lived in Vermont for 20 years. And like, you know, in Vermont, winter is the whole in Vermont, Vermont is like winter, but, you know, you like move into summer, and when summer moves into fall, and fall really begins to move into winter, you experience this place where there's this tension between the two, and it's like you can almost feel them, like fighting till winter becomes dominant. And there's something about that tension and that kind of like liminal change over that we experience through the entire period of becoming that is emergent until we've kind of more arrived wherever we're going. The other thing I'll say about that is there's no arrival in emergence. So there's a forever deepening, which means that you also become adapted and acclimated to a kind of liminality as truth, not as temporal.

The other thing I'm going to tell you is foundations won't be enough, not because the infant is here, but because we live in a world that is literally colonized by the adaptive body, we need spaces that aren't of that that's not the same as we need spaces for healing.

But it's not from a defensive posture. It's from a posture of like, Oh my God. What is the word authority?

And there's something about that that really dovetails, because the way that the conceptual and the intellectual have hijacked the actual as a kind of shortcut or avoidance strategy for not only the experience of the actual, but the things that you have to do to get to the experience of the actual, this is kind of the fast food culture of westernization, for lack of a better way to frame it, which is that you can go to a weekend shamanic workshop, or you can take a bunch of psychedelics, or you can, you know, study Buddhist meditation or whatever, and conceive of the idea that those practices or those interventions will lead you to a place of integration, but what They often do is just amplify the gaps that already exist. And this is because those gaps live at such a fundamental or formative relational template within us that has been in place for so many 1000s of years and generations, that it is, what I say, kind of deeply intrinsic.

When the adaptive body is primary in somebody, they need the food and fuel of the existence field. Or you can think about it as the erotic and the love in all of its primal iterations in order for it to still exist. So these core things is what the narcissistic system goes after. So somebody asked a question in the question forum or post about what happens if you're a single mom and you're still trying to work this while being a single mom? So I'm going to answer that question in a minute, but what I want to say is that many, many people have become single moms and single dads because they were in relationships where there was real something, real coherence or connection, real love, but one person in there stayed with the adaptive body's predation as the primary source of connection, the other person who may have been predated upon did not like that. Now, if both people split up and they do not resolve that predation or narcissistic feeding loop, then it will just happen again, but ideally, you see that loop for what it is, and you close that loop back up within yourself. But that requires this down to the bone. Coming to terms with what is an adaptation. And what is actually truth.",

I think in a lot of emergence, we lose time, or time becomes elastic or transparent or less of a variable because we are making contact with a body that has not ever been bound by time. It's outside and larger than time. Some people would also say it's outside and larger than space. And that is for sure, true too.

It is also the the primal innocence, primal intelligence, and so the the guarding of that is can be so strong because we have repeatedly experienced the harm that has come from being vulnerable in that space, and having that vulnerability, like exploited or harmed, it also can be protected, not just because of the harm piece, but because you are, like, holding boundaries around it. Do you know what I mean? Like, because you know that this is sacred, that sacredness cannot have a place in your life until there is a certain other structure for it to appear in where it will not get harmed.

So I started playing with that and using lots of alternative practices, including contemplative meditation practices both Tibetan and Theravadin, and then also lots and lots of yoga practices. And my background was in both at the time. So in 2010 from what I had learned, I opened a clinic in Vermont, the Vermont Center for Integrative therapy, and I endeavored to create a clinical model that basically took what I was learning with eating disorders and having some degree of success with and advanced that into a model that would be good for everybody. I basically was like, if I take the most complex, hard to figure out thing, it can apply to everything that is less complex. So for 10 years, that's what we did. And during that time, I developed the model. I developed protocols for addiction, protocols for trauma, protocols for mood disorder, protocols for chronic pain, the whole deal, and we basically tested and played with that for 10 years with lots and lots of people.

No, but listen, there's two sides of nothing, which means that when you are in the nothing part that is the emptiness, that is the absence, that is the fear or annihilation part of the nothing. But then there is the other side of the nothing, which is the everything. And regardless of which side you're on, you are also holding the other because they are like two sides of a coin. So in some ways, the one that we favor, the one that we want versus the one that we don't want, and the wanting versus the not wanting is partially dictating which side you experience, partially. You heard me say, partially. Why is this important? It's important because, in general, when things get quiet and when there is more space, we tend to try to make ourselves exist, because in that space where we have experienced emptiness, there is anxiety that arises in the face of non existence. But the truth is, if we can feel our emerging movement of existence in that space of nothing, you will find that existence finds itself even in absence, Speaker 1 1:48 okay, hopefully you just swallowed all of that because that was a lot.

What are these components that I'm speaking about in like an addictive constellation? So the components that are really essential in here, there's multiple configurations, but one of the most important configurations is that addictions live in an upside down triangle where one side of that has to do with survival, one side has to do with compensation, and underneath it is material that has been exiled. And that material that has been exiled can be all sorts of things. So usually when we talk about this, we think about things like family secrets or like incidents that happen, like traumas that happen that didn't get discussed, or even if they did, they weren't responded to properly or appropriately. But in there as well is also your own desires and belongings. So it's not just those things that get exiled. It is also your own movement, your own aliveness. And usually what happens is that aliveness goes with the exiled material, because there's a need for survival, and whenever there is a strong need for survival, there will be a matching need for compensation, because, by definition, when you're in survival, you are missing some of the resources that you need in order to",

So you want to look at where you're following the rules, because where you might be doing the eating and the exercising from following the rules is going to cause a kickback in your addictions.

And so somewhere, those symptoms are kind of like, again, the canary in the coal mine for something that isn't being revealed. The tricky part about that, which this is, what it leads into, is that space of the double bind, where it feels like there has to be the speaking of the truth, but the system itself is organized around the restriction of the truth. And now what happens is there's a set up power struggle between the one that is claiming and speaking the truth and the rest of the system, whether that be internal or external or both, that is purposefully restricting the truth. And when that happens, there's a power dynamic that becomes intractable. And the nature of that is kind of this, this knot, which is the double bind. It's that you can't win in either of those situations. And really what's happened is that the contents are split between the two parties, the two poles.

But what really happened for me was that I had been sitting for about five hours in complete silence, and my awareness got super curious about what was in the silence. And when I asked on the inside, what's in the silence, I heard and saw, literally saw and perceived 1000s of vibrating molecules of possibility.

I got my degree a very long time ago, and when I first started practicing as a therapist, my first population of interest was teenage girls and their families. And within about the first, I'd say, five or six years, what I found was that there was this subset of them and their families that had this interesting blend of high intelligence, access to creativity, sometimes really challenging family situation, and pretty much all of them struggled with food, eating or their bodies. Sometimes there was a family history of it, and sometimes there wasn't. But the thing that was most intriguing to me was that no one was helping those girls, so the existing support that was out there seemed to be kind of barely touching the complexity of what was lying underneath. And at the time, I was a young clinician, and I was thinking mostly through the lens of psychology, because that's what I was trained in, what I really believed in at the time. And about three or five years after starting I got very ill myself with this illness that no one could figure out what it was about. And that took me on about a five year journey with alternative medicine, kinesiology, energy medicine, hormonal stuff, food, the whole deal, looking to understand why this set of symptoms seemed so incurable in me, and that everybody I went to see had a different idea about what was going on, but Nobody seemed to be able to touch the thing like there's",

This is really important, because in its mind, it is the thing, and what it uses in order to kind of hold on to the thing is some form of control.

It's just the way that existence moves through us as form, as part of the conversion from Formless to form. This is where the etheric goes from being unseen or the formless moves from Formless to form, okay, I say that again, in primary existence, you are dealing with the formless. It is the energy of Creation before creation has moved into form. In relational existence, it is counting on the qualification of that thing that is coming through you, that is coming from you being seen, confirmed or qualified and then brought into the world. That is the process. So if you have this experience of like radiating creation, and it wants to create something, but you feel like you have no mirrors or no ability to qualify your existence. It will get hampered in that process, and you will feel backed up. And this doesn't happen once this happens for a whole life, you guys, where the creative and the erotic gets backed up.

It's about the fact that your creative center is moving, but it is not actually generating on the outside. It isn't doing the recursive thing. So how do you find channels for that to talk?

Whether that's as like a drug addiction, sex addiction, shopping addiction, eating disorder doesn't matter what it is, but when those patterns become dominant in your system, when they become the thing that has colonized in a strong way, we see it and identify it as current day addiction. You guys all know that you can have this variance in there where sometimes what will happen is like that pattern shows up. Somebody goes to college, let's say, and in their first two years of college, all of a sudden they have, like, some sort of eating disorder that's never been seen before, and then something happens, and it's not there anymore, right? So it's like that thing hasn't shown up anymore. So it's not like it's actually gone when that happens.

I'm going to put a caution piece about it, because everybody in here ties into this. We witness somebody in their vulnerability. It is almost instantaneous that we want to make them feel better.

I started making maps, and I started looking at what the actual energetic structure was between the free flowing creative fields and that connection to the way that we are structured as humans because of oppressive systems. And when I speak about oppressive systems, you'll think about lots of different things, and it doesn't really matter where your thinking goes, the structure of them is almost always exactly the same replication. And what I found was that that structure was designed purposefully to restrict the free flowing possibilities, the access to free flowing love. It was basically harnessing this thing in many different ways and either occluding it, preventing it, resisting it, or full out blocking it. And so I started looking at the dance between those things, and how we might be sourcing that sense of emergent possibility that is always present, even while we're stuck in horrific oppressive systems, whether those are external, internal or both.

This is really a learning container, an experimental container, and one in which you will get to challenge the edges of what you think you know and what you believe to be true about some of the most important things that we all encounter, intimacy, connection, honesty, addiction, violence, sexual abuse, systemic oppression, neuro divergence, all of those things are going to be aspects that we're going to cover. And I'm going to invite you to go beyond what you have experienced with them, suicidality, darkness, depression, hatred, evil, all of it. Nothing is off the table. This model spans the full spectrum of expression, and it does it through the view that power, real power, and I'll define that real sex, the real erotic the original creative force, is what we are actually after, and that the Ways in which we are withholding from withholding within or being blocked from are causing many of what we now term mental health",

And the question is, where does that breath come from? Yeah, when you breathe, where's that particular breath coming from? And it will always come from a number of different places. Right? When you become more ecosystemic, you're going to be breathing from your ancestral one moment from your you know, from your moment of needing food on, the next moment because you're hungry and on. The next moment from your erotic self, because you're turned on. And so the reality is that the breath is going to come from all sorts of places, but it's your ability to actually dance with all of those breaths and not have one that is dominating all of the others, right? They can take turns, but it's whether or not one or a couple are controlling or hostaging your system in a certain configuration that is non natural, non organic, non emergent of that moment. So",

Anybody in here know what failure launches like? The terminology, yep, yep. So very common in like mental health circles, failure to launch basically means like you never leave home. And that never leaving home can be physical, but it is most often energetic. It can be psychological too, but really it's primarily energetic when people come to me in spiritual crisis, it is 98% of the time. It is because they cannot launch. They have not launched. And the number one thing that apprehends people's ability to launch, which is the path of individuation, not individuality This is different. Being an individual is different from individuation. Individuation is a maturity concept. It's a maturity outgrowth. So if you have not experienced enough relational existence, and I'm going to define that in a minute, you will have incomplete launching. And what will happen, as most of you have experienced, is that it'll be like parts of you are out of the birth canal, but not all of you, so it's like you're limping along towards launching right. It's like you take, like a leap, and then like, you go back. And part of this connects to what I presented at the beginning about working these edges and going all the way.

It creates reality fields and experiences that are based on recursive loops. That's the moving the furniture around. So by definition, it's absent of deep belonging, right? You will have to find your belonging elsewhere within that field, and in many ways, you will believe that nothing exists but that reality field. And what we know is that that will be one reality field, it will be many fractals of reality fields that all are cooperative to create a kind of experience of selfhood and of belonging to that self. There are also adjacent reality fields that will be the selfhood that you have within community culture. All of them come with accepted rules, accepted limits, right? Accepted experiences, even so we get, of course, we know we get tied into these things, a lot through belonging, but also a lot through identity.

Maybe in three months, I'll know something I don't know now, but what I know now is that the demands of this culture and the lack of access in this culture force a kind of dependency that is implicit in order to exist or survive at all. If it was different, we would have a different way of moving into that existence field that would be had a kind of smoothness to it. This has a kind of prickly wikiness.

That's a fucking illusion. And it's also not an illusion, because if you're living in a domestic violence situation, we better pay attention to your safety.

If I have not answered it fully enough, do um, so I would say that what you're experiencing or describing is that when the wider context that I present and describe comes in and meets with the way that we have been narrowed in our understanding of our inner experiences, places that are stuck, shadow material, all of that content that when we get met with a body of language and fram",

And what I mean by that is the double bind exists naturally, so everything that is in polarity has an experience of this perception of choice, where both choices feel like they're either bad or they're either good, and you can't choose, right? We all have had these experiences, and sometimes you run against those choices that feel like both of them are so bad that you become entangled in trying to find a solution, right, like no solution feels like it's going to get you anywhere. So you try to manipulate the thing to kind of get both sides of it, or you manipulate yourself so that you don't lose both sides of it. So we do all of these contortions when we experience double binds. And primarily the way that enslavement systems use double binds is with your power and your belonging. That's where you perceive that your belonging is outside. You are dependent on belonging coming from the outside, and somehow the outside is holding that hostage in the face of you, so that you have to then give yourself away in order to earn belonging. This is classic, like abusive systems right to pick between your truth and the externals need for you to adapt to it or conform to it, so that you have belonging from the external. So when that gets internalized, one of the things that happens is that split between what's true for",

They think they think they know what I do, but they actually are clueless about what I really do. So we got into a discussion where she started to tell me, like, I mean, I don't really understand what you mean by that. And we were talking about eating disorders, which she has a 30 year history of that she recovered from about 15 years ago, but nothing has changed. She just doesn't use the behaviors, but the eating disorder plays out in all other channels in her life. So I was explaining to her that. At this colonizing body of control. When it is strong in us, it creates this kind of armoring on the inside, even if there's five layers above the armoring where you can receive when you get down deep enough there's a freeze and an armoring that's there, and that freeze and that armoring is responding to fundamental beliefs around the fact that life is not trustworthy, not your life itself. And we are often born into families where life is not trustworthy is the most important implicit message. Even before we're told anything in utero, we get this messaging.

This is where a lot of people begin to like move into pursuits of energetics or spirituality. You want to feel something that actually makes you feel more connection and more aliveness.

Existent is in some ways the same addictive cycle as being thin and being fed as existing. In general, highly sensitive people wind up being more aware of their experience of existence or non existence because they're just very sensitive, and I would say that they need more attuned sensing than others in order to perceive their existence. There's a quality there with both artists and with sensitives that are attuned to existence already, and they don't like to accept the rep, what I call the replication.

That continuum dances together. So you have to have enough sense of intactness, which we often call safety. I'm going to define the difference between them because I think of them as being very different, but you have to have enough intact sense of power and enough relational existence to go to the edges and stand there unflinchingly. Because it's not just about going to the edges. As soon as you go to the edge, you can't move from that edge, because as soon as you do, you collapse the whole thing back into the collapsed state.

When I teach this model to like other practitioners, that's part of what I teach, is learning how to place yourself on that map of where you are, because different instructions come at different times, and it's really important to understand, to attune to what is trying to be resolved at that time. And if you think of it as a kaleidoscope, we're moving through of different bodies all trying to cooperate into resolution.

So the real taproot here to use your language is to really understand the cooperation between how both of those things can exist at the same time, how we can be full of possibility and yet experience our life as being very narrowed in possibility, our choices as being very narrowed in possibility, our pattern repetition as being very recursive and narrowed, and that, in fact, this whole way is a way that returns you to living with emergent possibility as not just something that you conceptualize, but something that your system is constantly birthing and moving from. So when you view that moving field or the movement of existence in that SEER way that you named but your life is still living or lived experience is in narrowed possibility. Then one of the things that happens is, you know that is there, but it has not penetrated the experience of actually moving through your whole life. When it does penetrate the experience of moving through your whole life, what you find is that",

What it flashes to me is like the DSM diagnostic codes. So if you SM code for like depression, you will have different categorizes, categories. And so some of them will be like chronic, and some of them will be like more acute and episodic. So when you see the episodic part of blowing the circuitry it's going to look",

But to mistake that for true intimacy is an absolute mistake, because what we are lacking is enough experiences and places and people where true intimacy just exists, we have become so far from true intimacy and the creative, emergent expression that is undefended, that we have built formulaic structures into every part of our relating, and we have put our energy into Those formulaic structures as if they are the thing. In fact, what they are is just proxies we have employed as translations for intimacy from ourselves to anything else and anything else to ourself. And so when you put all of your energy into the proxy. What happens is you are constantly starving behind and within the proxy. We have taken that to such a huge magnitude now that our whole reality field is is, is that just that? And to me, this is what the return is.

But you can see already, especially because you're a practitioner too. Right, just through the course of these eight weeks, which is not very long, you can start to see how what once was disoriented to each other and is now beginning to find some sort of mechanical orientation with it again, and both sides need to know each other. Do you know what I mean? This isn't like, oh, the existence field is going to help the poor, downtrodden, adaptive body. No, no, none of those stories. This is mechanics. And yes, there are pieces that are physiological as well. So I want to touch on something else you said, which is sometimes, when you open up the velocity and intensity of the existence field, it will blow the circuitry on your physiological and nervous system body. And this is often the case because you have lived in collapse for so long that it's like if you are a body, if you, if you suddenly become a bodybuilder and builder, and you've never trained, you can't pick up the weight.

Bree 25:40 Okay, listen, this is the I've really said that, and the reason I would say no to that is only this that yes, maybe that would have been true at one time, but in a climate of systemic oppression, no one's going to fucking receive your truth. Maybe 10 people are, and if you wait for them to receive your truth, you're going to keep withholding in yourself. So we are at a time where we actually need to penetrate the bullshit with our truth, whether somebody can receive it or not.

And again, I am not talking about substance use. What I'm speaking about here is in measurement dependency and the inability to evolve when that is present, particularly over multiple generations. There is deep reactivity and deep fragility. Why is that? It's because, in essence, those members only have existence now through dependency and loyalty to the system, to the system itself and to the rules and mores of the system, even though it appears that that creates stability and strength. In fact, that creates weakness, deep weakness. I'm going to go off on a tangent here and say that if you look at the patriarchy, this is what you now see, is that over time, that extended loyalty has created deep fragility In the men, let's just say, or in the bodies that are for and loyal to the patriarchy. Now, on the surface it looks like strength, but underneath it is weakness, and that is because the ability, the ability to have any existence that is intact on one's own, in individuation outside of the protection of that system is not present. And so over generations, This weakens the line, literally, it weakens the family line. That fragility contributes in a significant way.

There's less of that kind of thing that happens and and then when you enter this space where it's kind of like a breaking off from normal reality. There are choices around whether to do that, because once you enter you're really you're in chaos, and you're in a big field. Some people enter those big fields for a period of time. They go through their own initiatory events, particularly with big awakenings, and then they incorporate them, and then they they find themselves where they fall somewhere back in normal living. But with that knowledge, some people then exist outside of space and time for the rest of this particular life. They do work on the grid, and they do work in the quantum and they come back and touch and then they leave. I mean, we've got lots of those people on the planet. Now, actually, I think we always did.

So I would say that the cultivation of the relationship with the adaptive body is the presencing of the leveraging of love of the double bind, and I would say that the cultivation of relationship with the emergent body is that somehow we long to know ourselves as something bigger than just what we experience in the day to day, And that both things kind of exist within us. So there's no problem about the adaptive body. It's always been there. It's part of this two body framework that I talk about that have to do with the way they relate to each other and the dominance of one over the other. That is the problem. The problem is that so much of our energy has gone into the adaptive body as our God, like I said, that we have given ourselves to it, falsely thinking that the return was going to be our power, when, in fact, the return is our loyalty to powerlessness. This is the central lie. It is truly the essential.

So the protection part of it is kind of like you are in a place where you now can receive love from others and the world around you, but you're still holding on to the variable of being unlovable, because it helps to keep certain degrees of intimacy or closeness at bay. And when I say intimacy or closeness, I'm not speaking about just interpersonal but I mean with everything, unlovable, unworthy, those things allow us to keep the world a degree or two away from us, and there's a feeling of safety in that, and a feeling of control. And so we like that that feels like we have agency, like we have something that we're doing that makes us feel capable and powerful. This is the lower end of the addictive spectrum. What we're talking about, this lives in the finer realms of control, the places where we're doing it, in response to our innocence, to our base vulnerability, not where we're doing it up here, out of greed or manipulation, but down here, where it's out of the the protective mechanism, yeah.

So I cannot emphasize its importance. It is also deeply ignored and under recognized in the field of healing, because we talk about instead all of the structures that seem to connect to non existence or the experience of non existence. And so for this reason, this model really emphasizes the imparting of primary and relational existence as being the most important thing in the connection to vitality, to your own expressions, to joy and to the fullness of intimacy in your life. I'm going to start out describing how I talk about and frame existence. Existence is love, but it is not the feeling of love. The feeling of love is more of an emotion or a state that we think about as being pleasurable, but real. Love, stripped of that emotion, is actually the pulsating movement of creation. It is the base of creation before creation has gotten adapted in any kind of way. It is clean, it is honest and it is naked.

And what I mean by that is that we're so uncomfortable when states of tension come up that we either give in, which would be my version of collapse, we try to control the situation in order to not have to experience the states of tension. Some people talk about those states of tension as being like places of uncertainty. I would go beyond that and say that they're really about places of power. So the tension is about our perception that somehow there's something we want or something we don't want outside of us, and then having that experience also on the inside, and that there's a power split between those spaces, and that somehow we we feel divided in our power, instead of hole in our power. When the double bind is present, it inhibits your ability to move, to choose you. Ooze, and so the adaptive body then comes in and creates a narrative, both like a story narrative and an experiential narrative that basically sends you like over here instead and through here, essentially.

So I'd like to start today saying a few things about larger systems and thresholds, and this applies to individual systems, obviously, as well as big systems. It seems really pertinent today because we're in this space where pollution is rushing at the door and people's responses to evolution, rushing at the door is usually some combination of resistance, Back, fear, denial, work arounds, avoidance, hiding whatever it is, or it is also a willingness, like a calm, I'm waiting for you kind of thing. So as we're in this space of thresholds where evolution is at the door, you know is that evolution will push for resolution. Why it pushes is because, essentially, you can't really go through that aperture or those gates the other side, so to speak, leaving anything behind. I'm going to talk about that in a minute. Nothing can be left behind to pass through that small aperture in the center, because what happens is, when you get to the other side and you open into that other field, what's there demands you to have all of you on that side. Now, if we're looking at a larger system, all of you can mean everybody in a family. All of you can mean everybody in a collective group, a society, a community. This is why, in order to really evolve, no one and nothing can be left out. There's no avoidance of certain thin",

So this is, you know, I have said for a long time that, um, wow, I've got a whole other thing going on today that's just like, why are you talking about this, but I'm going to talk about it. You know, this thing, this movement of existence, it can be taught in the way that we're talking about it, but really the way to understand it is to experience it. It wants to be felt. It wants to inform your experience inside, and it wants to give that to you so that you can dance with it in the way that you do your dance naturally. The material of it is less in the intellect and more in the way the intellect is a translation of the experience, not the opposite. So just like I start at the end, when I did the chronic study, it had no information that you guys are getting now, purposely, so that the experience would be there, devoid of the intellect, so that your mind doesn't interfere with what's happening. So in any ways that you're just feeling the energy is terrific. Okay, all right, any other questions? Speaker 3 11:50 Yeah, I have, I actually have just a comment or share.

We think of love as like something that like is temporal rather than abiding. We think of love sometimes as not being associated with power, but it absolutely is power in the way that I understand it. We think of love as being young, sometimes and innocent, but not the mature version of innocence. I think of love as actually being the matured version of innocence. Love is responsiveness. Love is naturally responsive. It does not have to think, it does not have to plan, it does not have to secure a future, and it does not have to rehearse the past. Love is presencing in action even when there's no action. That's also action. Love knows when to step forward and when to not. Love feels when it's being bargained with or negotiated. Love feels when it's being denigrated or taken for granted, and it doesn't come to those spaces. Love is exactly the equal to existence in the way I understand it, the way existence behaves, the way creative behaves, is the way love behaves.

And it will have to be the discernment between emptiness, which is actually fullness, and emptiness, that is vacancy. So in an awakening or a dark night, we often have experiences with the void, and there are multiple versions of the void. There's like the dark void, the light void, there's the like terrible empty void, where it's like the black hole and like you can't nothing is there. It's just nothing, nothing, nothing. There is cessation, and then there is the void that is actually very full. So it's helpful, I think, sometimes, to understand that there's different versions of emptiness and that it's fun to see what is there and to understand your relationship to them. What you're really looking for is the places where your judgment comes up, where your reactivity comes up, because that's the place where, obviously there's not neutrality, and there's not neutrality because there's a pull, there's a wound, there's there, and you're going to want to go after those things as part of this process, so that you can release the power that is in them that is causing you to be hooked the releasing of that chi or power will go back to you.

So an example of that might be like, I'm talking to somebody, and I sense that they're really angry at me. I don't know, but my mighty sense is, like, picking up that they're really angry at me, and I'm afraid of being angered at and so I start to, like, throw out things in multiple directions, to like, distract them, or get them to feel better, or like, I want them to, like, feel feel good about me, or I take them i",

So we start, we start looking for spiritual teachers, and we start looking for places where spiritual practices are the thing we're going to do. And so because of that, we are ripe for abusive systems in those spaces. And unfortunately, we have so poorly not decolonized that in spiritual spaces that we go in with this innocent longing that now is lighting up in us, and we we get, we experience the thing, and we experience it firsthand. I used to think that the world of therapy was the most oppressive, but I actually think at this point, there is more room in spiritual circles for them to hide and avoid than there is in psychotherapy. In psychotherapy, it's more visible. In spiritual circles, it can be way more covert, because there's a lot of power running in those spaces, and that power is something people are being attracted to. So this is where a lot of four and five you're going to spend a lot of meaty time there, and it may feel like you're not getting anywhere. You may have lots of physical symptoms this.

The survival part of it is what we usually label as like the hyper vigilant trauma response. There's not enough, the anxiety, the fears, the buckling down. Yeah, the compensation is the thing that happens because you can't get enough of the other things. So survival puts you in starvation. Compensation replaces the real thing that you don't have access to because everything is too tight. And it gets too tight because the system has become devoid or starved of the essential material that it needs for thriving and expression. If that happens a little bit or a couple of times, what you will see is the system returning to a kind of okay baseline when that happens repeatedly over time, and or if you are brought up in a society and or family in which the primary restriction is already very strong in the caregivers, the actual energetic composition of that will be imprinted onto you as a child, as the framework and template for relating, even if no one ever gives the verbal message about that scarcity.

If you're an intense meditator and you hit a place where you hit the lip. I don't feel enough of you guys have practiced meditation, but there's a place where there's blackout, where there's a death, there's a moment where it ends. It's called a fruition in Buddhism.

It's important to know that most of our core wounds occur in the primal body. They occur against the things that live in the primal body, sex, food, resources, connection, belonging. So all of that is going to be in that space, and most of the things that we react to or from are in that. If you have a wound that been untended in the primal body, it's going to show in a whole host of ways in the bodies that come after it. And usually what we pay attention to, for most of us that are on a healing path is, what which of these layers do you think we pay most attention to? The outer ones, right? And specifically when we get one layer deeper to the field of abandonment, right, right? Like we're paying tons of attention to that, that's good, because we need to pay attention to that. But if we don't pay attention to what comes underneath it, then we wind up kind of stuck circling in the field of abandonment.

So when I work with people around the primal body, I'm working with like dance, I'm working with walking, I'm walking with, working with not just breath practices, but looking at breathing, looking at the ways that breath is restricted or allowed, and even more complex, how those things work together, the",

One is that the thing itself, the earth itself, the thing that you're participating with, is way bigger than you, and that you have to have some degree of respect and reverence for that thing to even get on that board. And if you don't, it's going to knock your ass off like 10,000 times until you earn the proper respect for the thing. And the other thing that I say is that if you know those sports, you know that actually it's a constant calibration of movement, and that sometimes there are big moves, sometimes there are small moves, but most of the time, the moves are so imperceptible that they barely experience themselves as moves, and that the longer you do it, the more you become calibrated to the movement of the bigger body and less calibrated to the movement of the self. And so in doing so, what happens is you give a lot of your awareness, without even realizing, over to the bigger body. You trust it. You know that it has deliverance in a kind of way for you. And so that is this model in a nutshell, the ability to learn how to do that in every moment of your life, and to bow to the bigger thing, because we are the bigger thing.

To me, systemic oppression is the large scale inhibiting of natural movement or natural expression, for the sake of extorting that power To some, rather than others. And this leveraging of power or control of power, will ride on your sense of primal needs, things like food, shelter, money, belonging, identity, all of these are base needs that allow you, they are non negotiable, needs in some ways, that allow you to feel your sense of being, of existing, to have a certain baseline level of confidence, and confidence is not the right word. Existence is closer to that that allows you to move out into your life and in act and perform the things that come from your own being. If you don't have enough of those primal needs that have been met, it you will be literally tripping over them, literally when you try and go out into the world.

This is not adaptive as in bad this is adaptive as in descriptive of the way in which it takes the erotic and makes it fit a certain sense of reality, standards or rules or mores that It believes will gain you or maintain you acceptance so",

None of that was true, but this was the experience of her reality and how her internal reality had been formed in response and continued in response to that. She used to go to the ER after having passed out in the shower and bleeding from her head, and she would go to the ER over and over again, and no one ever asked her if she was struggling with food or if she had been starving.

So if you accept our reality to be an interwoven, shared dream, and what I mean by that is that you understand deeply that dreaming is not something we do at night, but rather something that is about reality, shaping and reshaping itself through us all the time, particularly in A co dreaming state, then you understand that there are big shapes that we are all agreeing upon. And when I say agreeing, it doesn't mean we want it or we like it, but at some implicit level, we are also participating in that CO dreaming of that part of reality. So it occurs to me that part of what has happened over time, and in this case, I mean linear time, is that we have distanced ourselves tremendously from our true belonging. And if you know my teachings, you know that I speak about existence as being the source of that true belonging, and our connection with all of existence itself. That includes, obviously, the natural world, it includes our relationship to everything that is as it is, without any distortion or interpretation. So the ocean is as it is. The trees are as they are. So if you understand that over time. We have gotten away from our relationship with this, our intimacy with this.

Now, the examples of leadership that we currently have are leadership that comes from control and domination. Oh, there goes the traffic. This is leadership from control and domination. Even if this is not the malignant type, this is still leadership over not leadership within. Leadership within requires an entirely different scaffolding than leadership over because leadership within knows and understands the value of trust. It also understands that real trust arises from safety, and that is the safety within all members of and from themselves. It also understands that integrity is paramount in this integrity does not mean always doing something or not doing other things. It means being in integrity with the moment for whatever the moment calls for. This is not a Global Integrity, but a moment to moment movement of integrity. This is also the movement of honesty. So in leadership and the fight for leadership, we could say that all conditions are pushing you towards leadership, and that in the absence of this kind of leadership, there will be all kinds of internal and external factors that will be pushing, pulling, wrestling towards where you find that safety and that leadership.

So usually we can maintain, oh, it just cut off, okay, so usually we can maintain the adaptive body, or what I call the lie until there is contact. So I'm going to talk a little bit about what contact is, because we often think more about presence than contact. But I would say that in my defining presence is a function or a quality of contact. Contact is actually a touching from the existence field itself, which means that that contact is seeing, perceiving, while also empty of any projection or distortion that might be present from that might be present from the adaptive field or The adaptive body. Now what happens with contact is that it begins to collapse or erode the hold that the adaptive body has on the individual. And so think of the adaptive body as like a celestial planet or celestial body, where the more presencing of the adaptive body that there is, the more occluded or shadowed the field of existence is, and the harder it will be to source it and find your move from that place. Remember that I talk about the reversal, which is that if the existence field is the sun, then you can kind of think of, kind of think of the adaptive body as the moon or something that is occluding the light, because the existence field is light from being seen or shining fully. Now there's a piece of the fact that when the existence field is running through the adaptive body, as you've heard me talk about, it fractures the light of that sun.",

Now how I define addiction is not the way most people define addiction. I see addiction as a continuum, and it doesn't really matter to me whether you're like using substances and an addict, or whether you're. Not using substances. What really matters at this fulcrum is how much of your own movement of existence you have access to, and the more of that you have access to, the less need there will be to replace that.

And so I started seeing the energetic constellation of what I had been working with starting to move. And I got in my car and I started driving to the gym. And as I started driving to the gym, it started moving faster. I started screaming, like screaming in my car. Rage like different I don't it was just coming.

Really important, because people who are in a high inflammatory state, they come to psychotherapy will often be tried to talk out of that. Reality is, when somebody is in high inflammation, there's actually no work you can do except hold them and feed them. What really needs to happen is the process relaxation, safety in the nervous system, in the body, has to go down enough to actually see what you're working with. I'm going to give example of eating disorders that you know. It's been 25 years of my work, and it is some of the most inflammatory conditions that you can work with. Also love, absolutely love eating disorders because they beautifully illustrate the way this model actually is they embody everything that I talk about here. So in eating disorders, if you were to go to residential treatment, you would immediately be put meds, usually, but then you would also immediately be put into like five groups a day, so you would be rep dedicated, and you'd be processing or working your eating disorder from day one. Now, listen, if you're in a heightened state of inflammation, the only that's not working if you are doing the work is body.

So you want to start really putting yourself on the side of the expression that is coming from your evolutionary emergent existence. Put yourself on that side. That doesn't mean also not, you know, using your adaptive body to maintain relationship. I'm not saying that, but if you do that at the expense of the existence field, you're still going to stay stuck in self abandonment. Does that make sense? Unknown Speaker 31:35 Yeah, Speaker 4 31:36 I guess part of why the grief is so difficult, or why it feels impossible, in some sense, is because putting the parts of the bodies that are maybe still stuck at 17 or 10 or 22 when you're actually 30 or 35 Unknown Speaker 31:53 like that, Speaker 4 31:55 that's like a dance that because you were supposed to do it at like 22 and 25 and a lot of the context that are quote, unquote supposed to exist, and I think that's where a lot of the pain and the grief comes from, is because it's not necessarily a question of how, because how is more of, like, an intellectual like, how do I, you know, put together a Rube Goldberg machine?

And then I, I mean, a lot of this ends up being really chemical in the way that the hormones show up at certain times of the day where it's like you have a crash because you've been digging in the wrong way. So that was a really wild analogy. But I think it makes the point. Bree 17:24 It does. And there's a piece that you're pointing to about rhythms and cycles and the generativity of syncing with rhythms and cycles without trying to resist or own any of those rhythms or cycles. And this is something that becomes kind of impossible on some level when you're in situations of force. This is why I talk about like the structure of force oppression, because it takes you out of a space in which you can even sync with those rhythms and cycles or that movement with in yourself, so that you can establish yourself in that natural space and connection and intimacy.

Matters because when you absolutely stop that from happening, what you create is widespread disease states, and in essence, what we're living in is a widespread disease state. This morning, on the way to the dentist, I was thinking about Nicole asking in the last call about these like this web of double binds. The truth is, we are all living in both this web of creation and this web of double binds in many different ways, we are constantly being asked to bring our attention, which is currency. Attention is money. Where you bring your attention. How that attention lands or doesn't land, how distracted you are versus how much you have the ability to lock in and focus is money you guys. Every bit of the competition in the wider world is a competition for your attention, because your power flows from your attention. So when you're pulled in 1000 different directions, it's virtually impossible to focus you, and when you can't focus you, and you can't be in your center, you are vulnerable to being pulled in many different ways. There's a way that, when that goes on for a long time, we adapt to being pulled that way. We adapt to being pulled in many different directions. And what do we do? We split ourselves in many different pieces to handle all of those different directions, and that fracturing becomes normalized in this time, on this first blessed",

And on some level, we know we're starving because there'd be no other reason why we would be living in repetitive addiction, other than we're starving for it. So the whole point of what I am showing you here is a view and an orientation. And even if you've been exposed to spiritual models, other models that are psychological, others that are blended, where they talk about some of those these concepts, they very rarely combine all of these elements and alchemize them. And why is that important? It's important because every one of those elements points to different kinds and layers of relationships that we're in. And in each of those layers of relationship, we are dancing a certain dance. And when you get distilled enough, I guarantee you you're dancing the exact same dance. In all of them.
